TrailLend Web System — How It Started

The TrailLend Web System began as a barangay-level digital transformation project in Barangay Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro City.
The goal was simple but impactful — to replace the manual lending process of tents, chairs, tables, and other barangay equipment with a smart, automated, and paperless system.

The development started with the web version, which serves as the central management dashboard for administrators.
This was built using Django (Python framework) for its reliability and scalability, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean, interactive interface.

The web system was designed to:

Allow barangay officials to monitor and manage all inventory items in one place.
Provide a transparent lending process where every request and transaction is recorded.
Integrate a QR code–based verification system using an ESP32-CAM module for real-time validation during borrowing and returning.
Generate reports, analytics, and notifications automatically for efficiency.
The project evolved as part of the barangay’s goal to modernize public service operations, reduce human errors, and promote accountability through digital tools.
Today, the TrailLend web dashboard works hand-in-hand with the React Native mobile app and IoT verification hardware, forming a complete barangay lending ecosystem.
